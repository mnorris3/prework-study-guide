# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is the beginning of my coding bootcamp, as well as my coding career. It was made with the intention of beginning the mastery of the basics of coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The making of this webpage is for learning the basics, however I already knew everything that was done in this introduction, but it was a nice refresher for me!

## Usage

This webpage is a simple one, it has some notes displayed about what was learned for each thing we did. And if you open up the dev tools, you will see some JavaScript running in the background, this also displays the topics we learned about, as well as giving a random output on which one you could study now.
